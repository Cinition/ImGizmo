# ImGizmo

ImGizmo is a Dear ImGui extension for adding 3D manipulation gizmos to the immediate mode context of ImGui. ImGizmo strives for great UX(User Experience) and bases most of its functions and usability on the great work by [Robin-Yann Storm](https://rystorm.com/blog/translate-gizmo-design). Alongside the focus on having a good base for the gizmos, we also aspire to make the gizmos customizable to your needs and even give the needs to easily create fully custom gizmos that cater to your specific needs.
